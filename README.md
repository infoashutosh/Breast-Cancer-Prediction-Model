# Breast Cancer Prediction-Model
After a detailed analysis of the readings of each model and the impact of the Voting Classifier ensemble technique, the following conclusions can be drawn:

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model demonstrates a slight improvement in accuracy after ensemble, from 91% to 92%. However, its performance remains consistent in terms of precision and F1-score. The K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) model experiences a decrease in accuracy after ensemble, from 93% to 91%. However, like SVM, its precision and F1-score remain unchanged. The Random Forest (RF) model exhibits the highest accuracy both before and after ensemble, with an improvement from 94% to 96% after ensemble. Additionally, RF maintains consistent precision and F1-score values.

Considering the overall performance and accuracy improvement after ensemble, the Random Forest (RF) model emerges as the preferred choice for the final solution. Despite a longer model time compared to SVM and KNN, RF provides the highest accuracy and robust performance, making it the optimal choice for this classification task.
